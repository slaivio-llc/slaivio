# SLAIVIO Cargo Scenarios And Priorities

Source: `/home/akiemane.j/Downloads/Scenarios .pdf` / `Scenarios .pdf`

This document is the working product map for SLAIVIO. It keeps the attached scenario file aligned with the current development priorities.

## Product Rule

SLAIVIO should stay focused on:

- Clerk for authentication and agency/team access.
- Official Meta WhatsApp Cloud API for WhatsApp onboarding, inbox, messages, templates, webhooks, and delivery status.
- Cargo operations from quote to delivery, with finance and warehouse controls.

Legacy WhatsApp provider routes such as Twilio and Infobip should not be exposed in the active product unless a future paid customer explicitly requires them.

## Priority 1: Production Trust Foundation

Status: in progress / mostly implemented.

Goal: make sure every active operation belongs to the right agency and no demo tenant/provider leaks into production behavior.

Covered by recent work:

- Clerk-only dashboard auth.
- Active tenant usage across backend operations.
- Meta-only public WhatsApp surface.
- Removal of demo login and demo WebSocket token.
- Central `APP_ORG_ID` fallback for development.

Remaining checks before calling this fully finished:

- Ensure Railway backend has `APP_ORG_ID` set correctly.
- Ensure `WHATSAPP_PROVIDER=meta` in production.
- Confirm Meta webhook receives real inbound message and delivery status in the right org.
- Confirm Clerk organization membership is synced by webhook.

## Implementation Principle

When a phase introduces a feature, it should be checked against this map:

- Does it create or update the right tables?
- Does it produce business events?
- Does the dashboard expose the operational queue?
- Does the WhatsApp/AI layer know how to answer or escalate?
- Does the workflow protect money, identity, cargo status, and agency ownership?
